# General Member Election Procedures
The OpenSSF elects General Member representatives per the terms of its [charter](https://charter.openssf.org). This document outlines the steps taken by staff and community members to conduct a fair and efficient election for those roles. 

General Member representatives serve one year terms commencing on March 1 and ending on February 28 of each year. The election procedures will take place in February of each year over the course of approximately 2.5 weeks.

## Reviewing Eligible Election Participants
**January 31 or next business day**: OpenSSF Staff reviews the list of General Members in good standing - those with active memberships with current or paid invoices. The number of General Member Representatives to be elected is determined by the number of General Members in good standing. 

## Opening the Call for Nominations
**February 1 or next business day**: OpenSSF Staff will open the call for nominations via direct email to all General Member Voting Representatives and Technical Contacts. The OpenSSF Governing Board and TAC are also notified that the election period is commencing. An example of this notification email is included below.

The Call for Nominations email will include the election timeline and instructions for nominating candidates. It will also include instructions for changing an organization’s voting and technical representative. The Call for Nominations will close after 7 days, and may be extended until enough candidates have been received to fill the available roles. 

## Nominating a Candidate
To nominate oneself or another for a General Member Representative position, nominees should send an email to operations@openssf.org with the following information:
* Name of Nominee
* Title of Nominee
* Nominee’s Organization
* Short Bio of no more than 150 words

OpenSSF Staff will confirm that the candidate 1) belongs to an eligible General Member Organization, and 2) is willing to be nominated (if the candidate has been nominated by someone else). 

## Creating the Election Ballot
**February 8-10, or within 7-10 days of the Call for Nominations**: OpenSSF Staff will submit the candidates and their information to the General Member Voting Representatives and Technical Contacts, and OpenSSF TAC via email. 

If there are more than 3 nominees, an election will be conducted using an electronic balloting tool. If there are three or fewer nominees, those persons will be elected unopposed. If there are no nominees or one or more seats remain open, a second call for nominations will be sent.

OpenSSF Staff will use an election tool such as OpaVote to create and share a ballot with the Voting Representatives of the eligible General Member organizations. Each organization will have one vote. 

## Running the Election
During the Election period, Voting Representatives will receive multiple reminders to cast their ballots if they have not already done so. These reminders will come from OpenSSF Staff as well as the balloting tool. 

Voting Representatives will have one week to cast a vote on behalf of their organization.

Election outcomes will not be shared until after the voting period has concluded. OpenSSF will announce the winners of the Election the day following the conclusion of the voting period.

## Announcing Election Results
The election results will be shared with the community the day after balloting has closed. OpenSSF will retain ballot records, but only the winners will be reported. OpenSSF Staff will announce the results to the Governing Board and TAC lists. OpenSSF may also publish a blog post about the election, and member organizations of the elected representatives are encouraged to do the same.
